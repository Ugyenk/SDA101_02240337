# Aizen Web Page

This project is a basic HTML page template called **Aizen**. The page includes a heading, a paragraph with bold text, an external link with an image, and a form that collects basic information like name, date of birth, and email.

## Features

- **Greeting Section**: Displays a "Hello World" message with a styled paragraph.
- **Link to CST Website**: Includes a link to the CST website.
- **Image Display**: Shows an image labeled "Creation" (ensure `Creation.jpeg` is in the same directory or update the path as needed).
- **Form**: A simple form for collecting a name, date of birth, and email with a submit button.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
- `Creation.jpeg`: (Expected image file) An image that should appear on the page. Make sure this file exists in the specified location.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the page.
3. Ensure `Creation.jpeg` is in the correct path to display properly on the page.

## How to Use

1. **Update the Link and Image**: Modify the `<a>` tag and the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag to link to your preferred website or image.
2. **Fill Out the Form**: Enter information in the form fields for testing. Submit button functionality can be extended with backend integration.
3. **Customize Text**: Edit the text in the `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<form>` sections as needed.

## Notes

- Ensure there are no typos in `<label>` tags and that each input has a matching `id` and `for` attribute for accessibility.
- Extend styling with CSS for a polished look.
